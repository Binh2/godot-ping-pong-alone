# Introduction

This is my first project in Godot so I want to make something simple but also new and creative. So, I come up with this cause I'm lonely.

# Basic gameplay

You are the player move around in a planetary movement style, trying to keep the ball in the center. Your goal is to keep the ball in the center for as long as possible.
